<h1> Different Types of ADHD </h1>

<p> There are three different ways ADHD presents itself, depending on which types of symptoms are strongest in the individual: </p>

	<ul>

		<li> Inattentive ADHD: Individuals with this type of ADHD find it difficult to plan or complete a task, follow directions or discussions, or follow instructions. Individuals can also get easily distracted or forget the specifics of daily routines. Inattentive type ADHD is what is often referred to as ADD. </li>

		<li> Hyperactive-Impulsive: Individuals with this type of ADHD tend to talk a lot, often interrupting others, unable to wait their turn, or speaking at inappropriate times. People with hyperactive-impulsive ADHD will also fidget, grab things from people, and have difficulty sitting still for long periods, such as while in class or watching a movie. People with this type of ADHD also feel restless and can act impulsively. As a result, accidents and injuries in people with this type of ADHD are more common. </li>

		<li> Combined: Individuals with combined ADHD demonstrate symptoms from both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive ADHD equally. </li>
